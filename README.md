Big data Analytics Capstone Project - Comparative Study of Machine Learning Techniques for the Early Detection of Diseases in IoT Env

#Introduction

#In a nutshell we are doing a comparative Study of Machine Learning Techniques for the Early Detection of Diseases in IoT Env.
#This paper proposes a classification method that is provides better classification accuracy than the Gaussian mixture model and logistic regression (i.e. NN,BPNN,CNN).
#The proposed classification method is a slight improvement to the Random Forest Classification, 
#by using Improved Dragonfly Algorithm (IDA) on the dataset for the better classification.
#In order to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, the different performance measures are analyzed and compared with existing methods.

#Existing methods
#convolutional neural networks
#neural networks
#backward propogation networks

#Proposed method
#random forest classifier (RFC) + IDA

#Expected results:
#The proposed method (RFC + IDA) provides classification accuracy better than the Gaussian mixture model and logistic regression (i.e. BNN, NN, CNN). Both training and testing process get the maximum performance rate that is 94.2% precision,89.99% recall in the proposed model.
